## Overview
In this challenge, i'll be building out an FAQ accordion. This is an extremely common front-end pattern, so it's a great opportunity to get some practice in!

### The challenge

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Hide/Show the answer to a question when the question is clicked

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript


### What I learned

I had difficulty getting the orange block and the woman at the computer images to position correctly.
I used negative margins and display: flex.

Snippets see below:

```css
 proud-of-this-css ðŸ‘‡
 .before-click.bold{
    height: 2rem;
    color: #1E1F36;
    font-weight: 700;
  }
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => ðŸ‘‡
for (let j = 0; j < answerElements.length; j++) {
          if (answerElements[j] !== answerElement) {
            answerElements[j].classList.remove('show');
            questionElements[j].classList.remove('bold');
          }
        }
```
